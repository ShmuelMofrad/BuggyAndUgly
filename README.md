# BuggyAndUgly
A repository with small code examples with code that is uggly and needs refactoring and/or has defects.

These examples can be used for "Group Programming" as a continuation of Pair Programming during workshops. After a short time in which the participants can familiarize themselves with the code, they take turns to do the following:
1. Deciding what the worst aspect of the code is.
1. Doing one refactoring / adding documentation / writing a test / whatever
1. Passing the keyboard to the next participant.

The facilitator of the workshop should ask questions about the decisions and give feedback.
